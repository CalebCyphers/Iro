## Introduction
Iro is a simple project built by me (Caleb Cyphers) for my third module final project at the Turing School of Software and Design. The project was to be a simple website that reaches out to an [inspirational quotes API called 'QuoteGarden](https://pprathameshmore.github.io/QuoteGarden/) and allows the user to find and save quotes that they like for use in journaling, scrapbooking, etc.

### Learning Goals

I'm taking this project as an opprotunity to re-affirm and streamline my workflows, all the way from the ground up. This will include:

- Foundational planning
- UX flow planning
- Wireframing
- Consistent Github workflow
- Consistent React architecture
- Clean routes with react-router
- Consistent TDD (Test Driven Development) using react-testing-library
- Consistent TDD using Cypress
- Design of clean, workable UI
- React Hooks
- Prop destructuring

### Setup

The repo was made using create-react-app and has not been deployed, so in order to view it: 

- Clone it down to a local machine, then `cd` into the repository and run `npm install` 
- Once the installation is complete, run `npm start` to spin up the development server.
- To view unit tests, run `npm test`
- To view Integration Tests, run `npx cypress open`

## Features

#### General Site Features
The site is a simple one. On the homepage, the user is greeted by a random quote from the api, along with four buttons.

###### Saving a Quote
 When a user clicks on a movie, that selected movieâ€™s details are rendered and displayed. Details for each movie include a title, tagline, overview, release date,  rating, genre(s), bugdget, revenue, and duration. There are a few instances where a movie does not have data representing one of these eight fields. In this case, that specific stat is automatically filled in with "N/A".

#### Responsive Design
There was a considerable amount of attention paid to building out the architecture for this app. This was met with the intended goal of making this site as responsive as possible.
