# Iro

Iro is a simple project built by me (Caleb Cyphers) for my third module final project at the Turing School of Software and Design. The project is to be a simple website that reaches out to an [inspirational quotes API called 'QuoteGarden](https://pprathameshmore.github.io/QuoteGarden/) and allow the user to find and save quotes that they like for use in journaling, scrapbooking, etc.

## Learning Goals

I'm taking this project as an opprotunity to re-affirm and streamline my workflows, all the way from the ground up. This will include:

- Foundational planning
- UX flow planning
- Wireframing
- Consistent Github workflow
- Consistent React architecture
- Clean routes with react-router
- Consistent Unit and Integration testing
- Design of clean, workable UI
- Consistent accessibility integration

## Foundational Planning

The first step was to design a (very) basic UX flow for the app...

Next, I looked around at other websites that worked and broke them down for inspiration and analysis...

After this, the first draft of the wireframe...

Next, I spoke with the app's target audience, a journaler, about how the woreframe felt to them, and after their feedback, made a new wireframe...
